# OIBSIP
For each project was created a new BRANCH.

## Level 2 - Task 1 - Calculator

Below you can see a short demo with my calculator created from scratch.
Also, you can open project if you clone the repo, just open HTML in Google or with Live Server in VSC.

The app is complete and can be tested in development mode, is not deployed yet.
The reason for making a new repository only for this ticket was because deployment needs to be done from main branch, so I couldn't make it here because I have different branches for each task.
